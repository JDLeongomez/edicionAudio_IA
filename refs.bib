My name is Jason R., and I started this YouTube channel in 2016, with the goal in mind to create high-quality, unique tech videos for YouTube. The response and growth I saw over the first several years of uploading videos absolutely stunned me, and making videos that genuinely helped people made me incredibly happy. Where I am today, I've gathered an incredible, supportive audience that I create regular technology and lifestyle videos for. But one thing I always want to emphasize on my channel is growth: meaning I want to create better, more useful, and more unique videos, grow my audience, and eventually make a career out of this hobby. If you support me and this vision, then please subscribe and we can make this happen! Music prod.
